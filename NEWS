Klebanoff0606T1 v.0.1.3 (2022-02-09)
====================================

* removed dependencies on `ABCUtilities` and `scABC2`

Klebanoff0606T1 v.0.1.2 (2021-07-14)
====================================

* updated use of `scABC2::make_long_dt()` in `tgrams.R` to reflect that function's change of parameter names (genes --> features)

Klebanoff0606T1 v.0.1.1 (2020-04-15)
====================================

* added list of clonotypes of interest (`cdrs0606T1`)
* re-worked the addition of the clonotype ID and clonotype frequency calculation
because I had formerly neglected to take into account the doublet removal
from sce.shared, i.e. the clonotype counts weren't reflecting the cell numbers
after that filtering step
* added additional entry to colData: `fit_for_test` that assesses whether a
given clonotype has sufficient cells in *both* conditions to be used for a
t-test
* `add_frequencies()` now allows to specify what type of feature should be counted
(sensibly, cdr3s_aa or id)
* `abbreviations_of_clonotypes.Rmd` has been removed as it is now part of the first
vignette (01_FilteringAndProcessing.Rmd)
